# Java-Socket-Programming
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

## First, the server.java file is run. The console screen shows that the server is connected.

## Then the client.java file is run. The console screen on the left shows that the client is connected. The console screen on the right belongs to the server. We send the string value entered by the client to the server. After the string value received by the server is converted to uppercase letters, it sends a response to the client.

## When "end" is entered, the connection with the server is interrupted.
